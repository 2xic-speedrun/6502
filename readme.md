**Update** Man, I don't want to debug opcodes again. I spent so many hours steering at EVM opcodes for [tinyeth](https://github.com/2xic/tinyeth/tree/main/src/evm).
The solution is already here, just need to debug, and i'm just not in the mood for that. The road to completing this is also now, just run the debugger.py and fix all the opcodes, and bam, it's working.

Goal was to write some rust code, and goal was reached.

----
~~Goal is to implement the 6502 [opcodes](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html) in two weeks, and be able to run the snake example game from [easy6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) by the end.~~

# Install
